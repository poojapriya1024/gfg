You are playing an array game in which you are given two arrays arr and brr, each of size n. Each array is a permutation of n positive integers. 

In one operation, you can perform either of the following two steps:
Rotate the array arr anti-clockwise.
Remove the first element of both the arrays if they are the same.
Find the minimum number of operations required to make both the arrays empty. 

Input:
n = 2
arr[] = {1, 2}
brr[] = {2, 1}
Output:
3
Explanation:
Rotate arr once and then remove both elements.


class Solution{
    public:
    int min_operations(int n, vector<int>&arr, vector<int>&brr) {
	    // code here
	    //approach: make the two arrays similar and then we can destory both the arrays
	    int count = 0;
	    while(!arr.empty() && !brr.empty())
	    {
	        if(arr[0] == brr[0])
	        {
	            arr.erase(arr.begin());
	            brr.erase(brr.begin());
	            count++; //increase the number of operations
	        }
	        
	        else
	        {   
	            //distance required to move the element to the front
	            int dist1 = find(arr.begin(), arr.end(), brr[0]) - arr.begin();
	            //distance required to move the element to the back
	            int dist2 = arr.end() - find(arr.begin(), arr.end(), brr[0]);
	            
	            //find the minimum distance for minimum rotation
	            int minRotations = min(dist1, dist2);
	            
	            // now rotate the array arr
	            rotate(arr.begin(), arr.begin() + minRotations , arr.end());
	            
	            count += minRotations;
	        }
	    }
	    
	    return count;
    }
};
